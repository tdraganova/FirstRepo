Ayumi Hamasaki, a.k.a. "Ayu", is dubbed "the Empress of Japanese Pop".

In 1998, she released several singles that did OK in the Japanese charts, but did not give her the fame she desired. Her 1999 debut album ‘A Song for XX’ debuted at number one in the music charts and stayed there for four weeks in a row. Ayu had arrived and her adoring fans loved her. She quickly became an icon and a style sensation.
